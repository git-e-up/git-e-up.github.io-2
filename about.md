Thanks for stopping by! I'm Matt, a web developer in Chicago. I recently completed a full-stack programming bootcamp at General Assembly and am looking for a full-time postion.

My background is in accounting, and while working in previous positions on accounting and HR software, I noticed many things could be improved upon, but I was not in a position to make those improvements on my own. This inspired me to make a career shift and here I am.

<i>Hi, internet. I'm here to work on you.</i>
